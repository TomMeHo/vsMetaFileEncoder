# About VsMetaFileCodec
## Summary
NAS manufacturer [Synology](https://www.synology.com/) provides, for its network attached storage devices (NAS), a video content manager called *Video Station*. The application enables the NAS to stream videos over your LAN. Information about these videos are stored in a local Postgres database and optionally by files with extension *.vsmeta*. The format is proprietary. 
The tool provided here is able to read and write vsMetaFiles. The structure has been elaborated by reverse engineering and resources found [here](https://gist.github.com/soywiz/2c10feb1231e70aca19a58aca9d6c16a). Many thanks to [Carlos Ballesteros Velasco](https://github.com/soywiz).

## Prerequisites
Once a video is written into a directory, *Video Station* looks for *.vsmeta* files if these conditions are met:
* The folder is part of a *Video Station* library.
* At least once, an export of metadata has been triggered. This can be done at the library settings of Video Station.
* The *.vsmeta* file has the same name as the video, appended by *.vsmeta*.
Example: The video is called `video.mpg`, the metadata file shall be named `video.mpg.vsmeta`.
* The *.vsmeta* file is available when *Video Station* indexes the video file first time.
* The content type (movie, series, other) is equal to the type specified in the *.vsmeta* file.

## Limitations
* Media type 'others' is currently not supported.
* All known fields are supported in this version (See list below).

## How to use the code

Here's an example piece of code. Other examples can be found in the unit test classes. Please refer also to [search_check.py](doc/search_check.py).

```python:

    import os
    from datetime import date 
    from vsmetaCodec.vsmetaMovieEncoder import VsMetaMovieEncoder
    from vsmetaCodec.vsmetaInfo import VsMetaInfo
    
    class writeVsMetaForMovie():

        def test_encodeTemplate4(self):

            writer = VsMetaMovieEncoder()

            info = writer.info
            info.showTitle = 'Kino - Filme'
            info.episodeTitle = 'Nach der Hochzeit'
            info.episodeReleaseDate = date(2021, 3, 8)
            info.chapterSummary = 'Um die drohende Schlie√üung seines indischen Waisenhauses abzuwenden...'

            writeVsMetaFile(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)),'videp.mp4.vsmeta'), writer.encode(info))
```

The code will be available on PyPI soon and can be installed with command `pip install vsMetaCodec`.


# Field mapping

Here's how to use the vsMetaInfo class for the different media types.

## Series

To encode the episode of a series, use the `vsMetaInfo` class with a `vsMetaSeriesEncoder`.
Have a look at the test classes to see how it works best. The table below describes how to set the `vsMetaInfo` properties.

| Field in Video Station    | vsMetaInfo property       | Remark                                                                      |

## Media type 'other'

This media type is not supported, and probably won't. It is intended for private videos or artwork, which will be edited most likely manually at uploading.

## Screenshots of the property screens for the media types

Here are the screenshots of the supported media types in German English (I did not have English screenshots at hand - please add them if you have).

# How to contribute

You're welcome to contribute, but please be aware of ...

* You should provide a unit test for your changes with a good coverage. To do this, install ``nose2`` and ``coverage`` and execute the tests with:

    ```sh
    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install nose2
    $ pip install coverage
    $ nose2 --verbose
    test_encodeTemplate2 (testvsmetaSeriesEncoder.TestVsMetaEncoder.test_encodeTemplate2) ... ok
    test_encodeTemplate3 (testvsmetaSeriesEncoder.TestVsMetaEncoder.test_encodeTemplate3) ... ok
    test_encodeTemplate4 (testvsmetaSeriesEncoder.TestVsMetaEncoder.test_encodeTemplate4) ... ok
    (...)
    ```
* I won't react immediately with checking your pull requests in, but will try to do it within some days.
